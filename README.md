# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model
Predicting whether a person has a ‘Heart Disease’ or ‘No Heart Disease’. This is an example of Supervised Machine Learning as the output is already known.  
It is a Classification Problem.  As we have to classify the outcome into 2 classes:

1(ONE) as having Heart Disease and

0(Zero) as not having Heart Disease.


#DataSet Description:

There are 14 features(Columns) including the target. The data set includes features like:

1) slope_of_peak_exercise_st_segment (type: int): the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, an electrocardiography read out indicating quality of blood flow to the heart .

2) thal (type: categorical): results of thallium stress test measuring blood flow to the heart, with possible values normal, fixed_defect, reversible_defect.

3) resting_blood_pressure (type: int): resting blood pressure.

4) chest_pain_type (type: int): chest pain type (4 values).

5) num_major_vessels (type: int): number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy.

6) fasting_blood_sugar_gt_120_mg_per_dl (type: binary): fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl.

7) resting_ekg_results (type: int): resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2).

8) serum_cholesterol_mg_per_dl (type: int): serum cholestoral in mg/dl.

9) oldpeak_eq_st_depression (type: float): oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, a measure of abnormality in electrocardiograms.

10) sex (type: binary): 0: female, 1: male.

11) age (type: int): age in years.

12) max_heart_rate_achieved (type: int): maximum heart rate achieved (beats per minute).

13) exercise_induced_angina (type: binary): exercise-induced chest pain (0: False, 1: True).
